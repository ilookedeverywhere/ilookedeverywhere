      <description><![CDATA[I was trying to test out making 3D paint strokes using Krita, as a test to place on a 3D model. I got distracted, and made this instead. The strokes to the right reminded me of a palm tree, and the blue in the back reminded me of water. That's why I named it "A Tree By The Beach".]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[#music | Why was I excited? I'm not sure. Maybe because this is the first song I feel excited to have made. But that might be just me reverse projecting emotions onto it. I really don't remember! It's kind of a demo right now though, which means it isn't complete yet. Still, I hope you enjoy it.]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[Sometimes, you need to make art just for yourself. Sometimes when you give yourself the least amount of pressure, you make something you really like. Who cares what other people think! I don't! That's not really related to this image, but what the heck. Love, Elli]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[#art | Feminismo means "Feminism" in spanish. It's pretty popular right now to wear plain t-shirts with just a little design on it - called "norm-core". Although I like this as an image, I think fashion can be a lot more exciting and fun and I want to push that when I make clothing in the future. However, the most important thing to me in fashion right now is sustainable practices.

I don't know how to write about this, but if you're curious I'll try to sum it up as simply as possible.... ]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[#art | I've always liked the idea of Thumbelina. Here, I was exploring the idea of a girl who grew up in a bottle - protected, but out of touch with the experiences she yearned for. In this image, she is looking up at the stars and holding her hand up, trying to be closer to the world outside the glass.]]></description>
