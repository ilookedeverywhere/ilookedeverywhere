        <p>The older I am, the more I appreciate and love plants. My Mom was always gardening when I was a child and I would help her. Back then, it was pretty 50/50 whether I liked doing it or not. But now, having a garden to tend like my mama did is something I dream of all the time. In our apartment in Los Angeles, we are growing quite a few plants in pots. I wasn't sure at first if I could keep the plants alive, but with attention and care the plants are living and growing beautifully. Tending to them and watching them grow, struggle, and even bloom is keeping my spirits up.</p>

		Another inspiration for this image are botanical prints. Again, my Mom was a part of this because she had many botanical prints in the house. Some part of those images must have really stuck with me when I went to college and made this image. I didn't realize it until she pointed it out to me. Now, looking at this a few years later, I want to iterate on that idea. Thanks mama!
