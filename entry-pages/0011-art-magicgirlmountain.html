        <p>Sometimes, you need to make art just for yourself. Sometimes when you give yourself the least amount of pressure, you make something you really like. Who cares what other people think! I don't! That's not really related to this image, but what the heck. Love, Elli</p>

        <p>Tech:</p>
        <p>I work in maya, but when I made this I was experimenting with what Blender can do. I didn't "color" this image, instead I made a mushy sculpt of a figure and lit it with lights. Once the general shape was there, I drew over it with the black lines using Blender's 2d drawing tools directly in the viewport. I rendered the whole image and this is what it looked like. The background mountains during the rendering process because distorted, which is why they have that glowing "glitchy" effect to them.</p>
