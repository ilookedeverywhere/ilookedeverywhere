        <p>Feminismo means "Feminism" in spanish. It's pretty popular right now to wear plain t-shirts with just a little design on it - called "norm-core". Although I like this as an image, I think fashion can be a lot more exciting and fun and I want to push that when I make clothing in the future. However, the most important thing to me in fashion right now is sustainable practices.</p>
        <p>I don't know how to write about this, but if you're curious I'll try to sum it up as simply as possible. There are many articles online that talk about it if you search "fast fashion sustainability" or "sustainable clothing" or anything like that. My poor summary is this: Much of the clothing being made for us is not sustainable when it comes to materials, labor, and production. Everything from how much water is used to process the materials, to how the materials are farmed (cotton) or created (polyester), to how much the laborers are paid are all worth paying attention to when you purchase clothing. There are many very cool and exciting brands that pop up on instagram that I would love to wear. But making hip or modern or luxury clothing right now isn't enough to make me excited to wear something. There's a barrier that I can't ignore when I look at their production practices. Fashion industry, instead of regurgetating the same designs over and over, think of something new that will really make a difference in the world! Luckily, more and more (cool) companies are doing just that so keep your eyes peeled, if you will!</p>

        <p>I used Marvelous Designer to create the clothing. I felt it needed something to make the image feel complete, so I added the picture of flowers I took just days before.</p>
